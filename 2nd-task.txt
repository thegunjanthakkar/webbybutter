Task: Create a Simple To-Do List Application
Objective: The goal of this task is to create a basic to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will help the trainee understand the fundamentals of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic JavaScript programming concepts.

Instructions:
Set up the HTML structure:
Create an HTML file with appropriate tags (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>, etc.).

Add a title to the page (e.g., "Simple To-Do List").

Design the user interface:
Create an input box where the user can enter tasks.
Add a button to add tasks to the list.
Create an empty unordered list (<ul>) to display the tasks.

Implement the functionality:
When the user enters a task in the input box and clicks the "Add" button, the task should be added to the list.
Validate the input to ensure that empty tasks are not added to the list.
Clear the input box after adding a task.

Add the ability to mark tasks as completed:
When a task is clicked, it should be marked as completed (e.g., by changing its text color or style).

Add the ability to delete tasks:
Add a delete button (e.g., "X" or a trash icon) to each task in the list.
When the delete button is clicked, the corresponding task should be removed from the list.

Optional: Add local storage support:
Store the to-do list items in the browser's local storage so that they persist even after the page is refreshed.
